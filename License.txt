I have designed this software and the appropriate hardware, 
because I required it for own, daily use. Hence I tried to make it as 
stable and reliable as possible and necessary for the designated 
applications (which normally are for the scientific or industrial market). 

This software, layouts, schematics, hardware and everything else that 
belongs to it may be used under a "Fair Use" license:

For non-commercial projects and tests, the use is completely free of charge. 
However, as soon as you make profit with it, you need to license the use. 
Do not hesitate to contact me, I am absolutely sure, that we will find a
fair agreement!

I give no warranty for anything! Using it is at your own risk!
